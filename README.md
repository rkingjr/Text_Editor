# Homework 19: A Better Notepad

## Description:

The purpose of this application is to be a simple text editor that can function online as well as offline. Data persistence options are used to make sure data is not lost. This application first looks for data in iDB to populate the editor then use local storage if it is unable to connect. As with any PWA, this application can be downloaded to your desktop as an application and serves as a help to developers as a digital pad for code snippets and coding ideas.
